This paper describes a set of analog front end design for contactless RFID smart cards that complies with ISO 14443-2 Type A Standard. It has been implemented using Global Foundries 130nm technology (GF130). The IC designed and implemented, presented in this paper, was then manufactured by MOSIS through the Educational Program. The analog front-end operates at 13.56MHz with a 106kbps data rate. This paper will show the simulation using Synopsys HSPICE and the corresponding test for the CMOS process GF130.
