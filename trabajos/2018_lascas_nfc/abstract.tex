This paper describes a set of analog front end design for contactless smart cards which complies with ISO 14443-2 Type A. It has been implemented in Globalfoundries 130nm (GF130) CMOS process. The design and implementation was manufactured by MOSIS through the Educational Program. The analog front end operates at 13.56MHz with data rate 106kbps. This paper will show the simulation using Synopsys HSPICE and the corresponding test for the CMOS process GF130.
