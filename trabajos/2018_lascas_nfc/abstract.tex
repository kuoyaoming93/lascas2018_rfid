This paper presents an interesting Analog Front-End Design of Contactless RFID Smart Card ISO/IEC14443A Standard-Compliant. The correctness of proposed circuit topology is verified by simulations and measurements. It has been implemented using Global Foundries 130nm technology (GF130). The IC designed and implemented, presented in this paper, was then manufactured by MOSIS through the Educational Program. The analog front-end operates at 13.56MHz with a 106kbps data rate. This paper will show the simulation using Synopsys HSPICE and the corresponding test for the CMOS process GF130.
