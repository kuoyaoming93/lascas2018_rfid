In recent years Radio Frequency Identification systems (RFID) have become very popular in many service industries, purchasing and distribution logistics, industry, manufacturing companies and material flow systems. In contrast with earlier techniques like barcodes, RFID is more favored because of its longer operation distance, higher precision, faster processing speed and storage capabilities. With it we can identify objects and store some data in a single silicon chip. This technique has been developed dramatically. This paper demonstrates the RF circuits design proposal of contactless IC card which comply with ISO/IEC14443-2 and validates the topologies with measurements. This design satisfies the performance request with the neat circuits, and has been implemented with 0.13um and 0.5um CMOS technology successfully.
