In recent years, Radio Frequency Identification systems (RFID) \cite{rfid_handbook} have become very popular in many service industries, purchasing and distribution logistics, industry, manufacturing companies and material flow systems. In contrast to earlier techniques like barcodes, RFID is more favored because of its longer operation distance, higher precision, faster processing speed and storage capabilities. RFID makes it possible to identify objects and store data in a single silicon chip. This paper studies the RF circuits design proposal of contactless IC card meeting ISO/IEC14443-2 \cite{nfc_spec} standard and validates topologies testing the IC. This design meets the performance request with the designed circuits, and has been successfully implemented with 130nm CMOS technology.
