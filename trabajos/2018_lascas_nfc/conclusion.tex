An analog front-end circuit for ISO/IEC14443A compatible RFID transponder IC was designed and implemented by using the Global Foundries 130nm (eight-metal/mim-capacitor) CMOS process. The measurement demonstrated that the transponder IC works properly (converts RF power to DC voltage, extracts the clock and data, and correctly sends data back). Using GF130 could reduce drastically the area in comparison with older technologies. This is a huge improvement compared with the existing products.
