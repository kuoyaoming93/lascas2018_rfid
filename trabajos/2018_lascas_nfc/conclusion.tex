An analog front-end circuit for ISO/IEC14443A compatible RFID transponder IC was designed and implemented by using the Global Foundries 130nm (eight-metal/mim-capacitor) and On Semiconductor 500 nm (three-metal/two-poly) CMOS process. The measurement demonstrated that the transponder IC works properly (converts RF power to DC voltage, extracts the clock and data, and correctly sends data back). Using GF130 could reduce drastically the area in comparison with ONC5. This is a huge improvement compared with the existing products.
