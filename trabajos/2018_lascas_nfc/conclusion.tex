An analog front-end circuit ISO/IEC14443A compliant RFID transponder IC was designed and implemented using Global Foundries 130nm (eight-metal/mim-capacitor) CMOS process. The measurements taken demonstrated that the IC transponder works properly and as expected: converts RF power to DC voltage, extracts the clock and data and correctly sends data back. Using GF130 drastically reduced the area in comparison with older technologies, what is a significant improvement.
