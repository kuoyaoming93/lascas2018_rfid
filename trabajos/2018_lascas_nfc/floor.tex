The corresponding layout is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:layout}, it was designed for Global Foundries 130nm. The analog Front End covers 0.3mm x 0.2mm (Fig. \ref{fig:layout}.a).

The design was shipped by MOSIS \cite{mosis}, it is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:layout}.b. In the next section will demonstrate the measurement of this integrated circuit and make conclusions about the results.
