The corresponding layout is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:layout}. It was designed for Global Foundries 130nm CMOS process. The analog front-end covers 0.3mm x 0.2mm (Fig. \ref{fig:layout}.a).

The GF130 design, explained in this paper, was manufactured by MOSIS \cite{mosis} and it is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:layout}.b. The next section will explain the measurements and tests performed on this integrated circuit and the conclusions made about the results.
